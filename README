jquery-mathml.js contains a patched version of jquery 1.4.4 to
allow MathML objects to be modified more fluidly. This is very
much a proof of concept work.

Working:
--------
 * selection of MathML nodes by id/class/attribute 
 * styling MathML nodes ( partial fix for http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5647 )
 * isMath query

TODO:
--------
 * innerHTML
 * display: none results in error message
 * add wrappers for native MathML styling attributes
 ( mathvariant, mathsize, ... ) as specified in: 
 http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-MathML2-20090303/chapter3.html#presm.commatt

License:
--------
Dual MIT & GPL ... i.e. do whatever you want just include the jQuery authors
and my name in any forks.
