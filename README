jquery-mathml.js contains a patched version of jquery 1.4.4 to
allow MathML objects to be modified more fluidly. This is very
much a proof of concept work.

MathML is only supported by Gecko ( Firefox ) and Opera based 
browsers at the moment. Internet Explorer and WebKit browsers 
partially support MathML but their coverage is *extremely* poor.

See: http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/MathML%20Status

DEMO FOR FIREFOX 3.6+:
 * http://sdiehl.github.com/jquery-mathml/

Working:
--------
 * selection of MathML nodes by id/class/attribute 
 * styling MathML nodes ( partial fix for http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5647 )
 * isMath query

TODO:
--------
 * innerHTML
 * display: none results in error message
 * add wrappers for native MathML styling attributes
 ( mathvariant, mathsize, ... ) as specified in: 
 http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-MathML2-20090303/chapter3.html#presm.commatt

Note:
--------

Firefox 4 beta is lightyears ahead of other browsers in terms of
MathML support, for example if you install the STIX fonts and
take a look at the following page you'll find it's nearly
identical to LaTeX.
